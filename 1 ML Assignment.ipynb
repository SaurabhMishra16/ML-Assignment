Anomaly detection involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected or normal behavior. Here's how unsupervised learning can be applied to anomaly detection:\n",

    "   - Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.\n",
    "   - Anomalies may lead to higher reconstruction errors when the model tries to reproduce input data, as they differ from normal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Isolation Forests:**\n",

    "Certainly! Here are some commonly used supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning Algorithms:**\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting continuous values by finding the best-fitting linear relationship between input features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of an input belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Trees:** Tree-like structures used for both classification and regression tasks, where each internal node represents a feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Used for classification and regression tasks, SVM aims to find the hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple classification algorithm that assigns a class label based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem that assumes features are conditionally independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Gradient Boosting:** An ensemble method that builds a strong model by sequentially adding weak learners (usually decision trees) and adjusting their weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:**\n",
    "1. **K-Means Clustering:** Divides data into clusters based on similarity, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting existing clusters based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Identifies clusters based on data density and classifies sparse regions as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto orthogonal axes, capturing the most important variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Autoencoders:** Neural network architectures used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning by encoding and decoding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs):** A probabilistic model that represents data points as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, useful for density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** Used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving neighborhood relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Isolation Forests:** Ensemble methods that isolate anomalies by randomly partitioning data points, requiring fewer splits for anomalies.\n",
